    <h1>LASAGNA</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpeg">
    <p>Lasagna is the perfect trifecta of ingredients: pasta, tomatoes, and cheese. Or, more specifically, the three main
        components of a classic lasagna are a red meat sauce, lasagna noodles, and a mix of ricotta and other cheeses.
        You can swap out any of these three components to make different styles of lasagna (white lasagna, vegetarian lasagna,
        spinach lasagna, etc.) but the recipe we have for you today is a classic lasagna with a tomato-based meat sauce,
        ricotta cheese blend, and lasagna noodles.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Red meat sauce</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>A mix of ricotta and other cheeses</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <p>Layer the lasagna in the following order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sauce first (this keeps the noodles from sticking to the bottom of the dish)</li>
            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Cook the penne pasta according to the package directions (boil 7-8 minutes, or until tender), then drain well in a colander. Allow the pasta to cool.</li>
            <li>Repeat: sauce – noodles – cheese two more times</li>
            <li>Finish with sauce and more cheese</li>
        </ol>
